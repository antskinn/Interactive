You
Digital, glowing, millions of bits firing away like neurons,
simplicity builds complexity, gateway to information, portal
to the world, 

Your Home
Fluffy friend, poodle companion, holds the tissue, does its job,
sits inside, a cold, damp room


Your street
Filled with crane flies, warm at night, the only place,
that has a light. Open to all, but visited by some,
this laundry room has one lit bulb

the neighborhood
towering high acrosss the street, light blue like the sky
and rising above the ballfield, holding water for the entire city
