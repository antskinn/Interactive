  <h1>Friction vs Flow</h1>

	<p> When I was first getting started with the internet, around 2007 (at the age of 7), the web was still seen as the 
	"alternative" to watching TV, in terms of a leusirely pasttime. That being said, I was astounded by the beauty of its
	simplicity. Videos on the front page of YouTube were uploaded by normal people, not with any specific fame-plans or
	moneymaking goal: WASP NEST REMOVED WITH FLAMETHROWER *DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME*. It was just regular, classic fun.
	
	Today, everything's become corporatized. You can't search up anything without the algorithm stuffing in your face
	a heap of mass-produced, ad-partnership'd content and channels. You can't search up the eerie alien and UFO videos
	of the early 2000s; today, you'd just get a video made for teenagers, with a thumbnail containing emojis. Something
	along the lines of "MEETING AN ALIEN?? (GONE WRONG) *MY REACTION WHEN IT WANTS TO DATE ME*." And I think that these
	examples extend well beyond just YouTube and video-streaming sites. Most areas of the internet, now, are corporatized.
	While the aim used to be such that anyone who paid a flat-price for internet access could access the internet's content
	(don't even get me started on the highway robbery of data usage billing), the content of the internet now seems monetary
	in some cases. If you access a newspaper article, you'll be prompted to subscribe to continue reading, for example.
	These things are understandable, as we now shift into a digital age the corporations themselves must go digital. But it
	can be an extreme waste of time for those of us who don't plan on spending any money, especially when these websites
	can appear at the top of the search engine results.
	
	Hopefully, things will shift back in the opposite direction. I believe they are; as more and more of the new generation
	turns to programming, more and more viable alternatives arise to traditional, corporate-owned sections of the web. This is
	not to say that these aternatives will overtake the web completely, but perhaps the added competition will cause web-based
	enterprises across the globe to take a new initiative, attracting users by bringing "fun" back into the equation.
