    <h1>&nbsp; &nbsp; Top 10 'cult classic' video games</h1>

      <li>
        Perfect Dark Zero
        <p>Set in a dark, corporate vision of the future, Perfect Dark Zero takes on the cyberpunk genre years before CD Projekt Red. In the shoes of a female protagonist, you'll be fighting your way through 'spiderbots' and crime lords alike, all while listening to an amazing original soundtrack.</p>
      </li>

        Dino D Day
        <p>Imagine call of duty, but with dinosaurs. Set in an alternate reality where Adolf Hitler is able to aquire T-Rex DNA, the allied forces must band together to fight giant carnivores with machine guns mounted to their heads. The rest is history.</p>
      </li>

       <li>
        Ecco The Dolphin
        <p>I can't say enough about this game, because I was never able to get past the giant clam that requests you put a pearl in its mouth. If I'm remembering correctly, that is. Ecco the dolphin brings beautiful 2D visuals and a dreamy soundscape to create a one of a kind experience. It's nostalgic for me because my cousin had this on his Sega Genesis.</p>

       <li>
        The Suffering
        <p>In this gorey horror game, you take on the role of Torque, the strong-but-silent type who is thrown into a haunted prison for a crime he has no memory of committing. As mysterious creatures begin killing everyone in the prison, things take a turn for the worse. Torque must be guided by his imaginary friend and psychiatrist, Dr. Killjoy, as they try to piece together what's going on- and how to escape.</p>
      </li>

       <li>
        Nether
        <p>This is a multiplayer survival scavenger game, set in the overgrown ruins of an abandoned city and its surrounding countryside after the planet is overrun by some sort of teleporting demon-like creatures. There isn't much explanation beyond that for the game that I've seen so far, but it was very fun to play with friends before hackers started cheating to get items.</p>
      </li>

       <li>
        GTA: San Andreas
        <p>Ninety percent of people have played this, and ninety percent of people have fond memories of it. Released in 2004, GTA San Andreas set a precedent that even follow-ups in the series have yet to beat. The memes, mysteries, and possibilities of this world persist in internet culture to this day.</p>
      </li>

       <li>
        Timesplitters: Future Perfect
        <p>A very unique series, TimeSplitters is a story-driven first person shooter that allows the player, at key-points in the game, to travel backwards or forwards in time and interact with their past or future selves. They then have to repeat the segment in the game again, as the future or past self. It takes place in the future, where humans are ostensibly using time travel to defeat a group of aliens.</p>
      </li>

       <li>
        Destroy All Humans
        <p>This classic, now sporting a remake, puts you in the role of Cryptosporidum 137, an alien of the 'Furon Empire' tasked with occupying earth. The mechanics are very neat, you're able to fly in Crypto's UFO and use it to destroy buildings from above, a mechanic I have not seen recreated in any game to date.</p>
      </li>

       <li>
        Portal
        <p>Combining the puzzle genre with the first person shooter, portal puts you into a futuristic science facility where you must complete a series of tests to be evaluated. Combining a very eerie soundtrack with an equally eerie backstory, this game is like no other.</p>
      </li>

       <li>
        Garry's Mod
        <p>The game within a game. The entire point of Garry's Mod is to mod it into something completely different. Built on top of the Source Engine, and using assets from the game Half-Life 2, Garry's Mod allows users to expand upon its content by importing their own models and writing their own code using the Lua scripting language. As a result, you never run out of possibilities.</p>
