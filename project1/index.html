   	<p>In 2050, America is owned almost entirely by private corporations. It has become a corporate meritocracy. With syndicate executives living lush lives at the top of Vertica, the city constructed above Horizon. Existing in a state of affluent carelessness. Anything happening on the ground below Vertica in Horizon is but an abstraction. On the street leve, crime and corruption runs amok in the poor quarters. Beyond that are regular works and administration. Your vertical living arrangement is determined by employment status. The more vital you become to Syndicate, the higher you climb. That's the narrative. However, the truth is rising just a little can take generation upon generation. Born a laborer, die an important laborer. Your child becoming a foreman, dying an important one. His child becoming an executive foreman, dying a manager. If you weren't born into an important administrative position, the chances of your lineage attaining executive status within less than six generations is non-existent. The currency is a cryptocurrency called Merit, because it is exactly that. The merit you as a person have in this society. The majority of the blockchains are controlled by Syndicate-run processing farms, to maintain their control of the economy. If your Merit ever reaches zero, you will be out of a job and roof over your head. Directly escorted to Horizon and into the Divide. And unlinked, off-the-grid portion of the country with relatively little, albeit excessively brutal and ruthlelss peacekeepers of ConSEC.
