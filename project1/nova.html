   	<p>In 2040, NOVA Industrial suggested the NOVA Initiative. To bring all criminals underground and save trillions in expenses previousy spent in the criminal justice system. These underground towns labelled by numbers, such as NOVA NINE, house those deemed criminal. Some, if not many, of the inhabitants here are virtually innocent, having either been in the wrong place at the wrong time, been wrongly accused and incapable of a proper defense, a lacking alibi or even framed by corporations. There are, however, many criminals and criminal organizations, much more ruthless and reespectively powerful than those above ground in Horizon.
