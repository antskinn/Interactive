   	<p>The Syndicate is the closest you will get to a government in Corpo-America. It was founded as a compromising effort to finally put corporate conflicts aside, and instead work together to govern and control the massive popuation. This, however purely led the rivalries and confllicts away from the open and into the shadows. Led by a board of directors and spearheaded by a chairman, who holds the final say. It is comprised of several of the most powerful corporations, who maintain a strong monopoly on the products they provide.
