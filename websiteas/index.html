  <h1>WEB DESIGN AS ENTERTAINMENT</h1>
  
  <body>
	
	
	
	<p>1. The website must be cinematic; just as a film it should tell a story that enthralls the reader. What sort of journey are they being taken on? What sort of input is required from them as they navigate the page? What lessons will they take away from your site? </p>
	<p>2. The website must have production planning; just as films are carefully theorized, constructed, deconstructed, and then re-constructed, web design is an iterative form of art that requires a digital sculptor whose job is to perfect it. </p>
	<p>3. The website must have a 'feel' or a 'theme', consider that distinctive feel of certain films or video games. </p>
	<p>4. The website, if at all possible, should leave the viewer with their own questions: is this site something that can be grappled with to squeeze it of more (i.e. discussion board), or is it merely one step in a larger chain of websites that one will explore when researching a certain topic? Can this site point them in the right direction?</p>
	<p>5. The website, like a film, must have 'calm spots', an image for example, where the user can rest amidst the flurry of text and information that swarms them otherwise. </p>
	<p>6. The website, like a theatrical piece, should (when applicable) incorporate inspirations and elements from a variety of other sources; these can even be other websites. </p>
	<p>7. The website, like a film, should be considered the alternative to the book; it can be used to convey the same message, but can be utilized to convey more in that way that a book cannot. It should not be the enemy of the book, but rather a unique alternative. </p>
	<p>8. The website, like a movie, should credit those who have worked to construct it. Or, at the very least, be equipped with some form of contact page (unless of course, the goal is to leave an aura of mystery). </p>
	<p>9. The website, if interactive, should be immersive to its purpose. Consider a point-and-click horror game, with the background of the page being a static-washed TV screen. </p>
	<p>10. The website, like a film, should be critiqued and vocalized about by those who visit it; preferrably, somewhere the site's creator can view and respond to this feedback. </p>
